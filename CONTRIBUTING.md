# Contributing to TCalc

Thank you for contributing. TCalc is local-first: workspace source must not be uploaded or sent to an external service by default.

## Set up

- Node.js 22 (the version used in CI)
- pnpm 11.5.2 (see `packageManager` in the root `package.json`)
- JDK 21 if you change the JetBrains plugin

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sandesh13fr/TCalc.git
cd TCalc
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

| Shared packages                 | `packages/`                                    | Run affected package tests **and** relevant CLI/MCP/editor smoke checks                                               |
| GitHub Action / CI / release    | `action.yml`, `.github/workflows/`, `scripts/` | `pnpm check:action` where applicable; explain checks that cannot run locally                                          |
| Documentation / catalog data    | `README.md`, `docs/`, `catalogs/`              | Check links and examples; use `node apps/cli/dist/index.js catalog validate catalogs/models.json` for catalog changes |

Select **every** affected area in the PR template. A change in `packages/recommender/`, for example, may affect the CLI, MCP server, and editor recommendations; mention those downstream effects rather than labeling it only “shared package.”

## Prepare a pull request

1. Star the [TCalc repository](https://github.com/Sandesh13fr/TCalc) before starting contribution work. This is a mandatory participation prerequisite for OSCI contributions; confirm it in the PR checklist.
2. Check for an existing issue and active PR before substantial work, then link the issue in the PR body (for example, `Fixes #123`). Assignment is **not required**: anyone may open a focused PR for any open issue. A short comment describing your approach is encouraged so contributors can avoid duplicating work, but maintainers will review eligible PRs on their technical merit rather than assignment order.
3. Create a focused branch from `Development` and target `Development` in the PR, unless a maintainer asks for another base. Keep unrelated issue fixes in separate PRs.
4. Add or update regression tests for behavior changes. Include a concise reproduction for bug fixes.
5. Run the relevant focused checks above. Before requesting review, run `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm lint`, and `pnpm typecheck`. Run `pnpm smoke:all` when changing shared packages, CLI, or MCP behavior. Use `pnpm run ci` for the full local pipeline (`pnpm ci` is pnpm's clean-install command, not this script).
6. Fill out the PR template: affected areas, issue link, behavior change, tests run with results, documentation, and privacy or compatibility impact. If a check was not run, say why. Add screenshots or a short recording for visible web/editor changes.
7. Do not commit generated `dist/`, VSIX, `.next/`, or JetBrains `build/` files.

## Code and privacy expectations

- Keep TypeScript in strict mode; favor small functions and existing shared modules over duplicated adapter logic.
- Add Vitest tests for TypeScript behavior, Node tests for the dashboard server, and Kotlin tests for JetBrains behavior.
- Do not add telemetry or default source upload. An optional network feature must be explicit, user-controlled, and documented.
- Preserve existing files unless the user confirms an overwrite. Explain changes to CLI output, MCP schemas, report formats, or editor commands because consumers may depend on them.
